<p class="">Four days before the partition of the subcontinent, and the birth of Pakistan, a flag was created. It was mostly green, with a sharp and bold white stripe. The green was for the Muslims in the newly created country and the white represented the religious minorities — the Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and many others — who called Pakistan their home.<br></p><p> </p><p>71 years since, Pakistan’s minorities have been visible in the Armed forces, judiciary, sports, education and entertainment. </p><p>Geo.tv remembers and pays tribute to some of these unforgettable names that make up the white in our flag:</p><h1>Dr Ruth Pfau </h1><div class="medium-insert-images ui-sortable"><figure contenteditable="false">

Dr Pfau, who was born in Germany, came to Pakistan in the 1960s and dedicated her life to taking care of leprosy patients. It was due to the endless struggle of Dr Pfau that Pakistan defeated the disease and became leprosy-free in 1996.
